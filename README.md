# vue-test
First Vue Task on WeJapa Internship.

## Task
So for those learning vue, here is our first task.
- Create a new vue application using the vue-cli
- The vue application would have a component called `MyName.vue`
- The component would be imported in our `app.vue`  file and accept a props called `name`
- The component is just going to render your name boldly in the center of the page
- Your code would be pushed to github, so ensure you have a github account
- Also, we would learn how to host our projects....and we would be using `netlify` or `firebase`
